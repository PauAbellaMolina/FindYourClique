# FindYourClique Telegram Bot
This Telegram Bot lets you find users with same musical interests as you.  
The goal is to create  communities based on musical interests and ultimetly making you find your clique!

I used [irazasyed/telegram-bot-sdk](https://github.com/irazasyed/telegram-bot-sdk "Take a look") PHP/Laravel SDK.  
I also used the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/ "Take a look").

Finally, I needed some way to get the users Spotify API Token.  
I solved this by creating [this](https://findyourclique.pauabella.dev "Take a look") Vue simple web app which makes users log in to their Spotify Account and prompts them their Spotify API Token which they have to now copy and paste it into the FindYourClique Telegram Bot conversation.
